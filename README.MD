## Config Before Start

Copy `config-example.yml` to `config/config.yml` and edit it.

```yml
cronTime: "*/5 * * * *"     # Cron time for backup task
defaultKeep: 7              # Default number of keep backups
outputDir: backups          # Output directory for backups
instances:                  # Instances to backup
  - host: 127.0.0.1         # Hostname or IP address of MySQL server
    port: 3306              # Port of MySQL server
    user: root              # Username of MySQL server
    password: P@ssw0rd      # Password of MySQL server
    databases:              # Databases to backup
      - name: database_name # Database name to backup
        keep: 5             # Number of keep backups for this database
```

**Note:** If the config file was changed, you should restart the application or container to reload configuration.
